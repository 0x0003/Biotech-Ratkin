  <Ratkin.description>A small humanoid race possessing rodent features which origins remain as a subject of debate. Ratkins have developed a feudal society with heavy cultural emphasis on agriculture. Their population consists of more females than males, and it is difficult to distinguish the gender of an individual Ratkin with their outward appearance.</Ratkin.description>

  <Ratkin_Su.description>A small humanoid race possessing rodent features. The rapid advancement of gene editing and transformation technology of the Human genome in old Earth necessitated a suitable Human analog possessing a near identical phenotype and genotype as test subjects. Human gene editing research proliferated for a long time but then the use of humanoid analogs were declared to be illegal due to ethical concerns. Unregulated genetics research was instead just moved away to distant Rimworlds. With the advancement of Human genetics, the use of humanoid analogs eventually became obsolete. Millions of test subjects suspended in cryo sleep ended up in abandoned research facilities in space. Some populations that survived planetfall of their vessels found their way on planets in the Rim, adapted to their local environment and eventually developed a stable breeding population despite the increasing instability of the Human Y chromosome, an unresolved but ignored problem in humanoid analog test subjects, which made viable male offspring rare.</Ratkin_Su.description>
